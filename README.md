Berkeley Data Analytics Homework 7 Distinguishing Sentiments/News Mood

I created a Python script to perform a sentiment analysis of the Twitter activity of various news oulets: BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York times and to present the findings visually feature the following:

-a scatter plot of sentiments of the last 100 tweets sent out by each news organization, ranging from -1.0 to 1.0, where a score of 0 expresses a neutral sentiment, -1 the most negative sentiment possible, and +1 the most positive sentiment possible. Each plot point  reflectd the compound sentiment of a tweet sorted by its relative timestamp.
- a bar plot visualizing the overall sentiments of the last 100 tweets from each organization, aggregating the compound sentiments analyzed by VADER.

I have used the folling tools: tweepy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, textblob, and VADER. The data is finally exported into a CSV.
